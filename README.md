# Gridding

These are the sources for the gridding problem.
The sources are as follow:

- [./python](python): Optimizations on the original code itself.
- [./C_python](C_python): Offload of the gridding function to C and parallelization with hybrid MPI/OpenMP.
- [./CUDA_python](CUDA_python): Offload of the gridding fuinction to multi-GPUs with CUDA and MPI.

For a summary of the results and scaling and bottlenecks see the jupyter notebook.
